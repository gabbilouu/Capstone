# Elevate: Mental Health Companion App
## Overview
Elevate is a mobile mental health companion application designed to help college-aged students track their emotional well-being, manage tasks, and encourage healthy habits through gamified plant-care features. By completing self-care tasks, users nurture a virtual plant, visually reinforcing positive behavior. The app also integrates events, reminders, and a lightweight community feature for accountability and engagement. 
In its latest iteration, Elevate introduces an AI-powered emotional insights feature. Using user check-ins and tasks engagement patterns, the AI can detect mood trends over time and provide tailored recommendations for self-care activities. This makes the app more adaptive, offering personalized nudges and progress feedback beyond static reminders.
